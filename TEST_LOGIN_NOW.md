# URGENT: Login Test Required

## Security Middleware Temporarily Disabled

I've temporarily removed the security middleware to test if basic authentication works.

## Please Test Login Now:

1. **Clear your browser cache and cookies** (important!)
2. Navigate to: **http://foo.localhost:8000/login**
3. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `admin@foo.com`
   - Password: `password`
4. Click "Sign In"

## Expected Result:
You should now be able to login and see the dashboard.

## What to Report:
1. Did you successfully login and see the dashboard?
2. Or did you get redirected back to login?
3. What URL are you on after clicking "Sign In"?

## If Login Works:
I'll re-enable the security middleware with proper fixes.

## If Login Still Fails:
There's a deeper issue with the authentication system itself that we need to investigate.
